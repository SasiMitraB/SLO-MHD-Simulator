# SLO-MHD Simulator  

**SLO-MHD Simulator** is a Python-based learning-oriented library for Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. This project is a personal exploration into the fundamentals of MHD simulations, with the goal of creating a basic, beginner-friendly simulation library.

## Project Status  
ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**  
This repository is in its very early stages. There is no functional code yet, but the goal is to build a simple, modular, and extensible MHD simulation framework.  

---

## Goals  
- Implement a basic 2D MHD simulation framework.  
- Generalize the code to work in 3D.  
- Focus on simplicity and educational value, not performance.  

---

## Roadmap  
1. Set up the 2D grid and basic solver structure.  
2. Implement numerical methods for solving MHD equations.  
3. Add visualization tools for analyzing simulation results.  
4. Generalize the framework to 3D.
